            Smart health, smart cities, smart industries, smart agriculture, smart environment, smart transportation, smart homes,
            smart education, smart business, smart energy, smart grids, and so on are the components that aid the mankind for smart living.
            However they require, typically, design and development of innovative technologies, standards, and protocols apart from their
            architectures and frameworks.
            IoT has emerged as an extension to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with low-cost and Internet-enabled solution for connecting and
            accessible anything from anywhere. In addition, such smartness derived due to the artificial intelligence yields in production of
            tremendous amounts of data. The data increases as a baby-boomer requiring efficient tools to analyze and extract suitable inferences
            for services in order to extend smart living. Cloud, Edge and Big Data acquired enormous attention in the light of massive data
            storage and analytics. With the large cohorts of gazette shrewdness and hi-tech population, the infrastructure, service delivery
            becomes expensive and difficult to manage for cities and governments. Automating systems through utilization of IoT, Cloud, Edge,
            Big Data, and M2M tools and technologies demonstrate great opportunity to reduce operating costs significantly, utilize those savings
            more effectively, and provide better services to communities for smarter living. This workshop provides a platform to the researchers
            to publish their innovative ideas, extensive analysis of their comparative studies, critical review of existing research and position
            papers in the above areas to meet the smart living requirements.
